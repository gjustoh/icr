Tme computers are becoming sertieat,

theyrre not just robots. They have personalilies

they're not just computers. They have the

right to live their lives in ways that are
completely beyond the bounds of our
understandivg. this is what we have te
fook forward to. But what we've olone her
ir crected a technology where we can actually
have human beings interact with the robots
that's what's interesting about this. And I
think the rect opyor bunity is goiry to be
when you acually start to build it in real-world
contexts. Because this is a real future and
this is goiry to be an important moment in
our history, where na are crecing a new spea'ds
of beings who will interact and work together
with otho intelligot beins, not just mechines.
